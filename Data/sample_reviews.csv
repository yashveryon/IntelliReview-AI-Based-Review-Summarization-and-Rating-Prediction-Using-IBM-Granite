Review
"The hotel was clean and well-located, but the service was slow and the staff seemed disinterested."
Absolutely loved the view from our room! Staff was friendly and breakfast was amazing.
Not happy with the cleanliness of the bathroom. Beds were comfortable though.
"Excellent stay! The check-in was smooth, room was spotless, and amenities were top-notch."
"Terrible experience. Noisy neighbors, broken air conditioner, and rude front desk staff."
